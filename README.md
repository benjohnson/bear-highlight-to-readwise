# Extract Bear Highlights to Readwise

This set of scripts dumps Bear to files on disk, scans for highlights, and sends those highlights to [Readwise](readwise.io).

Based heavily on Andy Matuschak's [Bear Markdown Export](https://github.com/andymatuschak/Bear-Markdown-Export)

I'm not sure if this is the best way to do this, but right now this puts all highlights in a book with the name/author set to "Bear Notes". The specific note title is put in Readwise's note field.
